## 🔭Overview

* [**BRIGHT**](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/17/6217/2025/essd-17-6217-2025.html) is the first open-access, globally distributed, event-diverse multimodal dataset specifically curated to support AI-based disaster response. It covers **five** types of natural disasters and **two** types of man-made disasters across **14** disaster events in **23** regions worldwide, with a particular focus on developing countries. 


* It supports not only the development of **supervised** deep models, but also the testing of their performance on **cross-event transfer** setup, as well as **unsupervised domain adaptation**, **semi-supervised learning**, **unsupervised change detection**, and **unsupervised image matching** methods in multimodal and disaster scenarios.

Note that the code in this repo runs under **Linux** system. We have not tested whether it works under other OS.

**Step 1: Clone the repository:**

Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/BRIGHT.git
cd BRIGHT
```

**Step 2: Environment Setup:**

It is recommended to set up a conda environment and installing dependencies via pip. Use the following commands to set up your environment:

***Create and activate a new conda environment***

```bash
conda create -n bright-benchmark
conda activate bright-benchmark
```

***Install dependencies***

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



### `B. Data Preparation`
Please download the BRIGHT from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14619797) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Kullervo/BRIGHT). Note that we cannot redistribute the optical data over Ukraine, Myanmar, and Mexico. Please follow our [tutorial](./tutorial.md) to download and preprocess them. 

After the data has been prepared, please make them have the following folder/file structure:
```
${DATASET_ROOT}   # Dataset root directory, for example: /home/username/data/bright
│
├── pre-event
│    ├──bata-explosion_00000000_pre_disaster.tif
│    ├──bata-explosion_00000001_pre_disaster.tif
│    ├──bata-explosion_00000002_pre_disaster.tif
│   ...
│
├── post-event
│    ├──bata-explosion_00000000_post_disaster.tif
│    ... 
│
└── target
     ├──bata-explosion_00000000_building_damage.tif 
     ...   
```

### `C. Model Training & Tuning`

The following commands show how to train and evaluate UNet on the BRIGHT dataset using our standard ML split set in [`bda_benchmark/dataset/splitname/standard_ML`]:

```bash
python script/standard_ML/train_UNet.py --dataset 'BRIGHT' \
                                        --train_batch_size 16 \
                                        --eval_batch_size 4 \
                                        --num_workers 16 \
                                        --crop_size 640 \
                                        --max_iters 800000 \
                                        --learning_rate 1e-4 \
                                        --model_type 'UNet' \
                                        --model_param_path '<your model checkpoint saved path>' \
                                        --train_dataset_path '<your dataset path>' \
                                        --train_data_list_path '<your project path>/bda_benchmark/dataset/splitname/standard_ML/train_set.txt' \
                                        --val_dataset_path '<your dataset path>' \
                                        --val_data_list_path '<your project path>/bda_benchmark/dataset/splitname/standard_ML/val_set.txt' \
                                        --test_dataset_path '<your dataset path>' \
                                        --test_data_list_path '<your project path>/bda_benchmark/dataset/splitname/standard_ML/test_set.txt' 
```


### `D. Inference & Evaluation`
Then, you can run the following code to generate raw & visualized prediction results and evaluate performance using the saved weight. You can also download our provided checkpoints from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15349462).

```bash
python script/standard_ML/infer_UNet.py --model_path  '<path of the checkpoint of model>' \
                                        --test_dataset_path '<your dataset path>' \
                                        --test_data_list_path '<your project path>/bda_benchmark/dataset/splitname/standard_ML/test_set.txt' \
                                        --output_dir '<your inference results saved path>'
```

### `E. Other Benchmarks & Setup`
In addition to the above supervised deep models, BRIGHT also provides standardized evaluation setups for several important learning paradigms and multimodal EO tasks:

* [`Cross-event transfer setup`](bda_benchmark/README_cross_event.md): Evaluate model generalization across disaster types and regions. This setup simulates real-world scenarios where no labeled data (**zero-shot**) or limited labeled data (**one-shot**) is available for the target event during training. 

* [`Unsupervised domain adaptation`](bda_benchmark/README_cross_event.md): Adapt models trained on source disaster events to unseen target events without any target labels, using UDA techniques under the **zero-shot** cross-event setting.

* [`Semi-supervised learning`](bda_benchmark/README_cross_event.md): Leverage a small number of labeled samples and a larger set of unlabeled samples from the target event to improve performance under the **one-shot** cross-event setting.

* [`Unsupervised multimodal change detection`](umcd_benchmark/README.md): Detect disaster-induced building changes without using any labels. This setup supports benchmarking of general-purpose change detection algorithms under realistic large-scale disaster scenarios.

* [`Unsupervised multimodal image matching`](umim_benchmark/README.md): Evaluate the performance of matching algorithms in aligning **raw, large-scale** optical and SAR images based on **manual-control-point**-based registration accuracy. This setup focuses on realistic multimodal alignment in disaster-affected areas.

* [`IEEE GRSS DFC 2025 Track II`](bda_benchmark/README_DFC25.md): The Track II of [IEEE GRSS DFC 2025](https://www.grss-ieee.org/technical-committees/image-analysis-and-data-fusion/) aims to develop robust and generalizable methods for assessing building damage using bi-temporal multimodal images on unseen disaster events.

* [`BRIGHT Challenge (CVPRW 2026)`](cvprw26/README.md): The [BRIGHT Challenge](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/15134/) at CVPRW 2026 extends BRIGHT to **instance-level** building damage mapping evaluated on **unseen disaster events**, with the setup, baseline, and **winning solutions** available on the challenge page.
